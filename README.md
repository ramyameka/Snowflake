# Snowflake
I have developed a Snowsight dashboard and conducted data cleaning using Snowflake within this repository.

Data_cleaning.sql - Within this project, an E-commerce company observed a concerning rise in the number of inactive customers. To address this issue, they decided to re-engage with these customers through a new marketing campaign. As an analyst, my responsibility was to identify the list of inactive customers who haven't made any transactions in the last 90 days. The output from this analysis was intended to be used for the marketing campaign. However, the available data in our systems presented several data quality challenges, including duplicated customer records, missing values, merged columns, non-standardized phone numbers, and incorrect data types. Additionally, I had to derive extra fields from dates, such as the days since the last transaction, to facilitate the identification of appropriate inactive customers.

Snowsight Dashboard - In this project, I utilized the data readily available in the Snowflake marketplace. The project focused on a fictional fast food chain called 'Rare Burger,' which sought to comprehend and enhance its market share in the U.S. For this purpose, I created a virtual data warehouse to efficiently load and query data within Snowflake. My analysis involved examining market share, daily sales across different regions, and comparing them to main competitors like KFC, Subway, and others. Furthermore, I explored the total number of customers based on location, along with their spending patterns, both in-store and online.
